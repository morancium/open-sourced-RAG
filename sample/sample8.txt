About Inspire Brands
Inspire Brands is a multi-brand restaurant company whose portfolio includes more than 32,000 Arby's, Baskin-Robbins, Buffalo Wild Wings, Dunkin', Jimmy John's, Rusty Taco, and Sonic drive-in restaurants worldwide. Inspire Brands was founded in February 2018 with a vision to invigorate great brands and supercharge their long-term growth.
In an industry facing increasing disruption, our leaders saw an opportunity to build a restaurant company unlike any other - one that brings together differentiated yet complementary brands and aims to make them stronger than they would be on their own. Found inherently in the purposes of our family of brands, we identified a common thread between our restaurants - the capacity to inspire. From guest experience to career development to community well-being, Inspire plays a role in the lives of millions of people every day. Our purpose is to ignite and nourish flavorful experiences.
